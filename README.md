##The Odin Project - Etch-a-Sketch

This Etch-a-Sketch project was made for The Odin Project Foundations course.
It's used to learn and solidify DOM manipulation techniques along with
event listeners and using Google.

Things I learned from this project:

1. Using event listeners with callback functions to access element attributes
1. Using console.log to understand what is happening and what can be accessed with callback functions
1. Using google to find exactly what I need
1. Reading documentation and understanding what given function is used for
